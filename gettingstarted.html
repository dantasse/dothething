        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        Thanks for agreeing to write for Do The Thing! Here are some tips to get started.
        <h3>What to write emails about</h3>
Usually just try to find something that's actionable and useful. Like "click this petition" isn't really useful, while "oh no Trump did this bad thing" isn't actionable. But feel free to break either of these rules if you think it's a good idea. Also, try to focus it on just one Thing to Do, and make it as easy and quick as possible for people to figure out what to do and to do it.
        <h3>Topics</h3>
You can pick a topic if you want, or not - we all kinda picked topics at the start, but everyone kinda writes about whatever. It shouldn't be a limiting factor anyway, but more of a sense of "if it's your day and you don't know what to write about, maybe look up some recent news about that topic."
        <h3>When to write</h3>
I like to write them the day before, and then schedule them to go out in the morning. Some people don't do the thing if it goes out too late in the day. You're on every other Friday, so your first one will be two weeks from today. I like to set myself google calendar reminders for my day, and I recommend you do something like that too.
        <h3>How to write</h3>
Mailchimp is... maybe more complicated than it should be, but not too bad. To write a new email:
        <ul>
        <li>campaigns-create campaign-create email</li>
        <li>give it a name, send to Do The Thing entire list, enter in all the info you want (try to use the "x/1533" template, each day increase by one)</li>
        <li>on the "template" page, go to "saved templates - basic email" and that will make it look consistent and have some of the links that you'll want.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Things I'll do right now</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>I'll make you an email address (nobody ever uses em but whatever :)</li>
        <li>I'll add you to our google group of active writers</li>
        <li>I'll add you to the website, under "who's 'we'?"</li>
        <li>I'll add you to the Mailchimp account. </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>What info I need from you right now</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>what email address do you want (usually it's firstname@dothething.info but I can change that if you like)</li>
        <li>what email address should that redirect to</li>
        <li>if you'd rather I didn't list you on the website, let me know, otherwise I'll just list your first name and @dothething.info address</li>
        <li>if you want me to list a topic on the website, let me know</li>
        <li>any other questions, etc</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
