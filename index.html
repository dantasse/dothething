        <p>
        Do The Thing is a mailing list with a daily thing you can do to improve things in our country, with an emphasis on limiting the power of a corrupt minority president billionaire with tiny hands.
        </p>

        Consider it one small attempt to resist the betrayal and corruption of a Trump presidency.

        <h3>We value:</h3>

        <h4>Action over thought</h4>
        This list is much more about small things you can do, than about long term strategy, education, or theorizing. Those are all valuable too, but not what we're good at.
        <h4>Continuous improvement</h4>
        The emails you'll get may not be beautiful, may not be ideal, and may in some cases be mistakes. We'd much rather do 9 good things and 1 mistake, than 1 good thing and 0 mistakes.
        <h4>Calling people in</h4>
        Your uncle's a lifelong republican and thinks we should dump Obamacare and public schools, but he's maybe hesitant about Trump, and willing to fight the worst of the corruption and authoritarianism? He's one of us. Your neighbor doesn't maybe see that saying "All Lives Matter" totally misses the point, but she'll help donate to Planned Parenthood? Bring her in. Your friend thinks Trump's call to ban all Muslims is insane, but still wears a Cleveland Indians Chief Wahoo hat? She's in too. We don't endorse all their current beliefs, but we appreciate whatever fight they're willing to put in, and we welcome them and help them along becoming more fair, open-minded, and loving individuals. And we do not fall to the temptation to mock each other for our mistakes to make ourselves feel superior.

        <h3>FAQ</h3>

        <h4>Who's "we"?</h4>
        In the broad sense, all of us who support justice, diversity, tolerance, fairness, blah blah everything that makes America great. (and not "Great Again." Despite its incoming leadership, the United States is better than it's ever been.) In the specific sense, running the website and mailing list right now: just me, Dan. But this website and mailing list is not about me; it's about all of us mobilizing and using our collective power.
        <h4>What's your background?</h4>
        Nothing political, to be honest. Right now I'm kind of making this up as I go along. I like to think I used to do Level 1 politics (voting, following local elections, maybe occasionally calling a senator) but in times like these, we all have to level up. This list is my attempt to do Level 2 or Level 3 politics. Perhaps you can level up too.
        <br>Also, if you've got any political experience or can help do any of this better, I'd love your help. Let me know.

        <h4>Why not something more positive?</h4>

        This is a time for protest. A corrupt wannabe-tyrant has won the most powerful office in the world with a minority of our votes. We want to work together and compromise as much as possible; this is a core feature of normal democracy. But <a href="http://joshuafoust.com/this-is-not-normal/">Trump is not normal</a><span style="font-size:.83em;vertical-align:super">1</span>, and to pretend otherwise would mean allowing him and his party to move the goalposts.
        <h4>What's in a Do The Thing email?</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>There will be a direct Thing to do. So far, this has been mostly contacting congresspeople, phone banking, donating money, and writing to people.</li>
          <li>There will be a link to confirm that you Did The Thing. This is for feel-good points, so we can see "hey, 37 people Did The Thing yesterday!"</li>
          <li>There may be an indirect thing to do. This often will not accomplish anything by itself, but may help you do future things. Probably we'll always have one direct thing.</li>
          <li>There might be a "bonus" thing to do. Often these are simple but inessential things like clicking on petitions.</li>
        </ul>

          1. Please excuse Mr. Foust's anger at the voters in the first couple paragraphs, as it does not reflect this mailing list's attitude towards Trump voters. However, his attitude towards Trump himself is right on.
